- run `$ npm install`
- Use the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/) to create
  a new Application, then create a bot user with permissions matching
  `62679886928`.
  - Note the `application id`,
  - create a token, and note its value.
- In the dev portal, Create a new Oauth URL with the previously given perm
  interger, then visit it to install the bot on your server
- Locally, create a copy of `.env.example` named `.env`, then fill in the values
  - `TOKEN` is the bot token you made above
  - `APP_ID` is the `application_id` from the developer portal
- `$ npm run deploy` will assign the commands to your server.

  The bot is live!
